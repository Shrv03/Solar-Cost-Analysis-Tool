Solar Cost Analysis Tool

A simple and interactive web-based tool to analyze the cost and efficiency of solar energy systems. This project helps users compare on-grid vs off-grid systems, estimate payback periods, and understand net-metering credits. It is designed to make solar energy economics more accessible to both laypersons and professionals.

Features

 On-Grid vs Off-Grid Comparison â€“ Calculate costs, savings, and efficiency for both systems.

Net-Metering Integration â€“ Estimate credits from excess energy fed back to the grid.

Payback Period Calculation â€“ Determine how many years it takes for the system to break even.

User-Friendly Web Interface â€“ Interactive HTML-based tool that runs directly in a browser.

For Everyone â€“ Built for both technical and non-technical users to quickly assess solar ROI.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend (Optional): Purely client-side for now

Hosting: GitHub Pages (can be deployed directly)
